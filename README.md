5.5 Collaboration Diagram
This shows the login and verification process for users in the bus e-ticketing system. It highlights steps like email verification, checking the database, and redirecting to the booking process after successful login. If verification fails, it returns the user to the login page. 
It represents the interactions between different objects during user authentication and bus availability checking.
 User Logs In:
The User attempts to log in using their email or phone number.
The request is sent to the Login component.
 Email/Phone Verification:
The Login module verifies the provided email/phone details.
It sends a request to the Verification module for validation.
 Storing Details in Database:
If the email/phone details are correct, the Verification module stores the details in the User Database.
 Checking Existing Credentials:
The User Database checks whether the email/phone already exists.
 Login Failure Handling:
If authentication fails, control returns to the Login page for retry.
 User Selects Destination:
Upon successful login, the User selects a destination for travel.
 Check Bus Availability:
The System checks available buses for the selected route.

5.6 Sequence Diagram
This diagram shows how and in which order a group of objects works together in a system. This is an interactive diagram and this is mostly used by software developers.

A sequence diagram shows how objects interact in a particular sequence, illustrating the flow of messages between them. Let's break down the attributes and interactions of a typical railway reservation system involving Passengers, Railway Reservation System, and Admin:
Passengers: Provide login credentials, search for trains, check ticket availability, enter personal details, make payments, and receive booking confirmation.
Railway Reservation System: Authenticates users, provides train schedules, checks ticket availability, processes booking requests, validates payments, and generates booking confirmations.
Admin: Manages user accounts, updates train schedules, monitors transactions, handles inquiries, and generates reports for system analysis.
